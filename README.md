# **React Typescript EventEmitter

## Overview
This is a initial project for React x TypeScript
- Eslint is already set up, feel free to modify rules in .eslintrc.js
- Husky enables you to run some tasks before devs can commit, feel free to make it yours :P
- Do not ignore package-lock.json lol

## Pre-requisite
1. install ESLint plugin in your VSCode
2. Enable auto format on save in your VSCode

## Setup
1. npm install

## Scripts
1. npm run dev: To sprint up a local dev webserver with the hot-swapping module
2. npm run build: To build the package targeted with umd
3. npm run lint: To run linting for ts, tsx, js, jsx files under /src
